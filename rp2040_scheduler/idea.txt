Let the SDK the things to to

only use one vector table
on the default position

start core 1 with only pc set as sdk offers

let SDK use their stack logic

This sceduler allows running
PendSV SVC and Systick running through equal code

QQQQ make scheduler start at 

------------------------------
32 bit group to wait for
Threads an handler can set and clear bits

#tech prob : how handler clean set and clear bits

-----------------------------------
upper 8 or 12 bits are set automatically after time expires

----------------------------------
byte stream from and to handler

fill count automatically sets or clears a bit

fixed 4 lowest bits are connected to byte pipes
UART interface

----------------------------------
handler can inject a call back single executed thread element on event

UART interface
CAN over IP receiver
RAW ethernet receiver

thread can inject call back to other thread
make more low-level elements which can build higher 
communication theories 
-----------------------------------

tech check: handler makes svc call
tech check: misaligned stack frame

----------------------------------
